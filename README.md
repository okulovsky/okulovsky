# Hi, I'm Yura üëã

I'm an AI & Machine Learning expert with over 20 years of experience in software engineering, data science, machine learning, and AI. I've been working in these areas long before they went mainstream, with a strong academic background in Mathematics and Computer Science (PhD-equivalent specialization) and a passion for building real products that deliver value.

## üéì Academic foundation

I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science (with a perfect GPA of 5.0), followed by a PhD-equivalent dissertation specializing in Machine Learning. I have experience teaching AI, logic, and programming at the university level, including developing new courses in these subjects. A highlight of my teaching is creating a video-based Foundations of Programming course that was adopted by more than 10 universities. 

Additionally, I led a student research lab in AI and robotics and handled the practical and bureaucratic aspects of running it ‚Äî including major procurement processes. Under my supervision, students advanced to the finals of the **Eurobot Competition**, demonstrating strong technical skills and effective teamwork.

## üíº Industry experience

After moving to Berlin, I worked on a variety of AI-driven products, including:
- Chatbots and voice assistants
- **FashionAI**: a recommendation system that creates full outfits by selecting items that match each other and fit the customer
- Marketing scoring models
- Several minimum viable products exploring Generative AI

I also developed my own project ‚Äî **Kaia** ‚Äî an open-source, local-first kitchen AI assistant with the voice, face, and personality of my favorite anime characters.

Alongside my technical work, I mentored colleagues and students, helping them develop their skills and navigate projects. I also contributed to candidate evaluation by designing technical challenges and conducting interviews.

## üõ†Ô∏è How I work

I see the role of a Data Scientist as **scouting** on the frontier of technology: exploring new ideas, testing what's possible, and finding practical solutions that really help the business.
I believe in **product-focused** Data Science and Machine Learning ‚Äî applying these technologies to create genuinely valuable and useful products for people, rather than simply maximizing advertising efficiency.

I approach this mission as a generalist, working on products end-to-end:
- Designing and training ML models
- Writing supporting algorithms
- Deploying, monitoring, and maintaining systems
- Running A/B tests to evaluate impact

My engineering style emphasizes:
- Choosing the right approach for each problem instead of relying on "one size fits all" solutions: I select the most efficient approach, whether that's a cutting-edge LLM or a simple statistical model if that's the best fit.
- Creating robust, well-thought-out solutions that "just work" after deployment, without constantly breaking or requiring ongoing maintenance.
- Designing extensible systems that can adapt when the business suddenly needs new features no one predicted, without needing everything to be rebuilt from scratch.
